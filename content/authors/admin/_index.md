My research background is in machine learning and algorithm design with a recent focus on developing fair and efficient ML models. More broadly, I study the interactions between humans and AI and use my findings to design AI systems that augment humans’ abilities rather than replacing them. I got my Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech under the supervision of Prof. Santosh Vempala.

I am also a faculty at the [International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) and an associated faculty at the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS)](https://learning-systems.org/).
